Song-A-Day Feed

Adventify uses the Spotify API and OAuth access to create a publicly available playlist on your account based on a separate, private playlist.
Only one song is added to the public feed daily, and only the most recently added track is viewable on the playlist's view within the web application alongside a counter.
